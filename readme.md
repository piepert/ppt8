| --------- | ----------- |
| assembler/ | Is the assembler for the instruction set. It is **very** lowlevel and it's only used by the compiler. |
| compiler/ | More readable assembly-like language, transpiled into the assembly-language for the assembler. |
| bin2schema/ | Print content of compiled binary files as schemas of paper tapes. (It shows you which holes have to be punched, if you don't have an mechanical punching machine.) |
| emulator/ | The emulator for the binary files generated by the assembler. Instruction set is available here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y_HHZ2xy8PnaS7ix16irItfBv9OqgP2u0JNefaFCLTg |
